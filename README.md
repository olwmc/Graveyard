### Snake written in C and SDL
This is my first time using SDL, so hopefully I'll look back on it later and realize how terrible it is.

This is also one of my first programs in C in a long time. 

-d activates dark mode


### Incomplete and bad Forth interpreter
Info for interpreter from https://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/
It's pretty terrible, incomplete, and error ridden.

BUT I think it was an alright first venture into parsing.

### Brainfuck interpreter in JavaScript
Super-tiny-fits-in-a-tweet brainfuck interpreter.

Usage: g("+\[-\[<<\[+\[--->\]-\[<<<\]\]\]>>>-\]>-.---.>..>.<<<<-.<+.>>>>>.>.<<.<-.")

### Ankithing..
Really weird program I wrote in broken lisp. It takes files in the format

\[ \
front

back \
]

\[ \
front

back \
]

and turns it into a csv which can be imported into anki.

I wrote this program because I was playing around with lisp and I was tired of using the anki editor to make cards when I could just use vim.
