# Random projects and code for me to store

### (Almost) Working chip8 emulator
A chip8 emulator. Used this as a way to learn some more parsing techniques, not really as a full project.

### Snake written in C and SDL
This was my first time using SDL, so hopefully I'll look back on it later and realize how terrible it is.

-d (or pressing d in game) activates dark mode


### Incomplete and bad Forth interpreter
Info for interpreter from https://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/
It's pretty terrible, incomplete, and error ridden.

BUT I think it was an alright first venture into parsing.

### Brainfuck interpreter in JavaScript
Super-tiny-fits-in-a-tweet brainfuck interpreter.

Usage: g("+\[-\[<<\[+\[--->\]-\[<<<\]\]\]>>>-\]>-.---.>..>.<<<<-.<+.>>>>>.>.<<.<-.")

### Ankithing
Really weird program I wrote in broken lisp. It takes files in the format

\[ \
front

back \
]

\[ \
front

back \
]

and turns it into a csv which can be imported into anki.

I wrote this program because I was playing around with lisp and I was tired of using the anki editor to make cards when I could just use vim. 

### Cookie editor bookmarklet
One of the first programs I ever wrote. My high school disabled our cookie editors that we were using to get past the web blocker, so I wrote my own. Awfully written but I think it's nice to have. Weird variable names so that it is *unlikely* to collide with any webpage you run it on. I'm keeping it here as a programming baby picture.
